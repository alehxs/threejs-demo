# Gradient Sphere (Three.js)

This is me experimenting with Three.js where I am trying to understand WebGL lighting, materials, and animation.
The scene displays an animated icosaheron with a color gradient using `HemisphereLight`, overlaid with a wireframe mesh.

## Features

- Top-to-bottom lighting gradient via HemisphereLight
- Icosahedron mesh with wireframe overlay
- Smooth rotation animation
- Interactive camera using OrbitControls
